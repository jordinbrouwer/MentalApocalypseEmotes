# Twitch Emotes - Mental Apocalypse

Show Mental Apocalypse emotes by typing them as you would into Discord.

## Usage

This addon does not have automatic registration of Discord emotes through the Discord API, which means emotes must be added manually.

### Autocomplete

To trigger emoji autocompletion, simply use the ":" symbol, and this feature encompasses the Mental Apocalypse emotes as well.

### Known issues

> The emotes are not working.

Keep in mind that we're using [Twitch Emotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/twitch-emotes-v2) for registering and displaying the emotes. If this is not working properly, make sure you have the dependency installed.

> The emotes are not accessible via the minimap button.

At the time of writing, the addon does not offer support for Mental Apocalypse emotes through the minimap button.

## Feedback
